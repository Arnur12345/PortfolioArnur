# At 16, I Built an AI Companion for Online Meetings - RavenAI

Hey, I'm Arnur, and I'm working on RavenAI - a fully autonomous agent that transforms every Google Meet meeting into concrete actions.

I'm giving **FREE** access to an agent that can:
âœ… Transcribe entire meetings in real-time  
âœ… Create structured reports after meetings  
âœ… Answer your questions during and after meetings (AI Q&A)  

ðŸš€ **Coming soon - even more features, including:**
- Automatic task creation in Notion, ClickUp, Trello
- Report delivery to Slack / Telegram
- Meeting reminders and analytics system

If you want to reduce post-meeting routine work - try RavenAI right now:

I want to remind you that my goal is 10k users, and every registration, every visit to my site - it all means everything to me, so I'm asking everyone to make some interaction on my website.
